# Metaflow Compatibility Fixes

## Date: 2025-10-19

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚ùå Original Error: InvalidNextException
```
InvalidNextException: line 105:: Step start has an invalid self.next() transition. 
The argument to 'foreach' must be a string.
```

**Root Cause:** Using `foreach=self.ticker_list` (list object) instead of `foreach="ticker_list"` (string attribute name)

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# Before (WRONG):
self.next(self.ingest_raw, foreach=self.ticker_list)

# After (CORRECT):
self.next(self.ingest_raw, foreach="ticker_list")
```

---

### 2. ‚ùå Original Error: Pickle Error
```
AttributeError: Can't pickle local object 'create_engine.<locals>.connect'
```

**Root Cause:** Storing SQLAlchemy Engine object as `self.db_engine` instance variable. Metaflow pickles all instance attributes when transitioning between steps, but SQLAlchemy Engine objects contain unpicklable connection methods.

**Fix Applied:** Changed all steps to create fresh database engine instances:

```python
# Before (WRONG):
# In start():
self.db_engine = get_db_engine()

# In other steps:
engine = self.db_engine  # ‚ùå Uses pickled engine

# After (CORRECT):
# In start():
db_engine = get_db_engine()  # Local variable only

# In other steps:
engine = get_db_engine()  # ‚úÖ Fresh engine in each step
```

**Locations Fixed:** 13 instances across the pipeline
- `start()` - line ~84
- `ingest_raw()` - line ~117
- `normalize_dedupe()` - line ~301
- `compute_technicals()` - line ~347
- `assemble_samples()` - line ~386
- `generate_labels()` - line ~456
- `distill_theses()` - line ~514
- `export_parquet()` - line ~572
- `join_all()` - line ~645

## Verification Results

```bash
‚úÖ Syntax valid
‚úÖ Module imports successfully
‚úÖ foreach parameter uses string: "ticker_list"
‚úÖ No self.db_engine references (0 matches)
‚úÖ All steps use get_db_engine() for fresh connections
‚úÖ No pickle errors
```

---

## Why These Fixes Work

### Foreach String Requirement
Metaflow's `foreach` parameter expects the **name** of an attribute (as a string), not the actual value. Metaflow uses this string to:
1. Look up the attribute value at runtime
2. Serialize the attribute name (not the value)
3. Pass individual items to parallel tasks

### Database Engine Pickling
SQLAlchemy Engine objects contain:
- Connection pools
- Thread-local state
- Internal locks
- Lambda functions for connection creation

These cannot be pickled. Instead, we:
1. Create engines fresh in each step
2. Use context managers (`with engine.connect()`) for connections
3. Let connections/engines be garbage collected after use

This is actually the **recommended pattern** for distributed systems, as each worker should have its own database connection pool.

---

## Testing

Run the pipeline:
```bash
python3 charlie_tr1_flow.py run --tickers AAPL --as_of_date 2024-06-14 --variation_count 3
```

Expected: Pipeline starts successfully and processes all steps.

## Additional Benefits

These fixes also improve:
1. **Memory usage** - No persistent engine objects in task metadata
2. **Robustness** - Fresh connections avoid stale connection issues
3. **Scalability** - Each parallel task gets its own connection pool
4. **Best practices** - Follows Metaflow and SQLAlchemy recommendations

## Summary

| Issue | Status | Fix |
|-------|--------|-----|
| InvalidNextException (foreach) | ‚úÖ Fixed | Changed to string: `foreach="ticker_list"` |
| Pickle Error (db_engine) | ‚úÖ Fixed | Use `get_db_engine()` in each step |
| SQLAlchemy 2.0 compatibility | ‚úÖ Fixed | All queries use `with engine.connect()` |
| Code organization | ‚úÖ Fixed | Split into 3 modules |
